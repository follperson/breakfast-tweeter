# BreakfastTweeter

## about
This was created as a project for BreakfastConference 2019. 

Mostly a silly arty project so I could get more experience with webscraping and twitter's API.

## data

The breakfast corpus is from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com). I have recipe descriptions,
 as well as the directions available as corpora. I think the description one is funnier.  

Find the details of the scraping at my [recipe scraper repository](https://github.com/follperson/many-breakfasts).
